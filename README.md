# Introduction
Due to some well-known reasons, *LX Music* unfortunately had to drop support for built-in music sources. In order to solve the various troubles caused by having multiple music platform memberships, we created this project to conditionally provide music source sharing.

To put it simply, everyone provides VIP or SVIP accounts on different platforms, and in exchange experiences the VIP or SVIP treatment of other platforms shared by others.

# CHANGELOG
## Jun 18th, 2024
Great! After more than 3 months of maintenance suspension, we are reborn and usher in the new 1.0.1 version, but we only support IPV6 and the server is still located in Seoul, South Korea.
## Jun 17th, 2024
Update license to Apache License 2.0 and add attribution and responsibility notice.To avoid unnecessary trouble, **service is no longer available in Mainland China**.
## Feb 29th, 2024
We have successfully deployed trial music sources on servers in the Netherlands, Poland and the United States. Welcome to join our Telegram group to experience it!

# Requirement
We do NOT welcome individuals and organizations (especially **"Marketing Accounts"**) who are freeloaders and publicize this project!

If you do not have a VIP or SVIP account, you can also choose to pay to purchase one or bear part of the server cost (approximately ***USD $1.25 ≈ CNY ￥9*** per month).

For those users who already have relevant accounts, all you have to do is share your account for everyone to use.
