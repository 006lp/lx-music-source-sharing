# Introduction
Due to some well-known reasons, *LX Music* unfortunately had to drop support for built-in music sources. In order to solve the various troubles caused by having multiple music platform memberships, we created this project to conditionally provide music source sharing.

To put it simply, everyone provides VIP or SVIP accounts on different platforms, and in exchange experiences the VIP or SVIP treatment of other platforms shared by others.

# Requirement
We do NOT welcome individuals and organizations (especially **"Marketing Accounts"**) who are freeloaders and publicize this project!

If you do not have a VIP or SVIP account, you can also choose to pay to purchase one or bear part of the server cost (approximately ***USD $0.55 ≈ CNY ￥4*** per month).

For those users who already have relevant accounts, all you have to do is share your account for everyone to use.

# Links
These will be the only two communication platforms for the time being.
- Discord (Mainly used) : [https://discord.com/invite/THEh33Gc](https://discord.com/invite/THEh33Gc)
- Telegram : [https://t.me/+WQztNFXI2i8wMTRl](https://t.me/+WQztNFXI2i8wMTRl).

We do **NOT** welcome piracy. The consequences of all actions are borne by the user. If you are able, please pay to support other music platforms! If you use the services and support provided by this project, you are deemed to agree to the above ***terms and the GNU General Public License v2.0***.
